The YouLess Energy monitor is a Dutch product that measures current energy usage by detecting the turns of the rotor disc or LED-pulses of an electricity meter. More info (in Dutch) can be found here:
http://www.youless.nl/

It has the following output Parameters:
Meter.Total - Current total on the meter
Meter.Watts - Current electricity usage in Watts

Setup:
- IP Address
- Port number
- UpdateInterval

No Username/Password support, but it shouldn't be a difficult addition.

According to this post in the forum the widget uses a lot of resources. I cannot test this anymore as I no longer have a YouLess device.
